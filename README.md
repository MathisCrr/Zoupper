# Zoupper
## Description 📄
Zoupper is a game that I made a long time ago to practice JavaScript. 
As in power 4 you must line up 4 pawns to win. But you have the possibility of removing a pawn from below ("you zouppe a pion"). You cannot zouppe a column where a pawn has just been placed and you cannot place a pawn in a column which has just been zoupped. <br>
